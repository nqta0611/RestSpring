## To Run the Project:
  Assuming LAMP Stack already installed on your computer. See [tutorial of installing LAMP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-ubuntu-18-04) <br/>
  Recommend using Firefox with CORS Add On to avoid CORS error since this is a localhost development project.
  1. Start mysql server from terminal: <br/>
    ```mysql.server start```
  2. Start apache from terminal:<br/>
    ```sudo apachectl start```
  3. Run clean server by navigating into the backend folder and run: <br/>
    ``` ./mvnv clean spring-boot:run ```
  4. Depending on where your project at, the url to the website should be similar to: <br/>
    ``` localhost/paths-to-project-folder/RestSpring/FronEnd/ ```
